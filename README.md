## SUMARY
Pewlett-Hackard is a large company that has been around for a long time. As a number of employees will be leaving for retiremnt, Pewlett-Hackard is looking towards the future and have asked me to organize their data. Pewlett-Hackard will be offering retiremnt packages for those who are eligable and in addition want to insure that as employees leave the company those positions will get filled. 

## OBJECTIVES

1. Create a dataframe for those emplyees who are eligable for retirement based on the company critiea.  
2. Determine how many employees will be retiring, and specifically how many employees from each devision.
3. Determine which employees will meet the criteria to create a mentorship program to help fasciliate a smoother transition as new employees will be filling jobs from those who retired.

In order to organize and join the data I was given from the 6 csv files, my first step was to created a visial chart flow. The following chart helped me visualize the way the data sets correspond to each other and helped me identify common columns, unique data, and primary keys.
